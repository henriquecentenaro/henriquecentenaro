This is my attempt to solve the _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_ programming exercises. I discovered the book after coming across the famous MIT 6.001 lectures on YouTube. After watching the first twenty minutes of the first lecture, I was more than sure I was having access to a gem of Computer Science knowledge. Then, I made a search about the authors, Abelson and Sussman, and found out the book.

SICP is a famous book. Maybe you can find discussions about all exercises of it. You also can find a lot of discussions about excerpts or general issues. So why am I solving all exercises? Just for simple pleasure. The book is really well-written and has a lot of useful information. The first two paragraphs is just amazing; here is the second one:

> A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer’s idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer’s spells. They are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric programming languages that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform.
